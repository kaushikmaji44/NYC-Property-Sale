Dataset

The name of the dataset is sales.csv

Context

This dataset is a record of some building or building unit (apartment, etc.) sold in the New York City property market over a 8-month period.

Content

This dataset contains the location, address, type, sale price, and sale date of building units sold. A reference on the trickier fields:

BOROUGH: A digit code for the borough the property is located in; in order these are Manhattan (1), Bronx (2), Brooklyn (3), Queens (4), and Staten Island (5).
BLOCK, LOT: The combination of borough, block, and lot forms a unique key for property in New York City. Commonly called a BBL.
Note that because this is a financial transaction dataset, there are some points that need to be kept in mind:

Many sales occur with a nonsensically small dollar amount: $0 most commonly. These sales are actually transfers of deeds between parties: for example, parents transferring ownership to their home to a child after moving out for retirement.
